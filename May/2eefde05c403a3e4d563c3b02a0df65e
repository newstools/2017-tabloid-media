Alternative transport was promised to convey commuters to their destination, however after two hours had lapsed, the crowd became impatient,&#8221; said Marshall Security&#8217;s Kyle van Reenen.The broken down train was then set alight as the crowd voiced their dismay at the delay. Reenen reports that passing vehicles including police vehicles were damaged as the crowd hurled bricks from the protest.&#8220;Crowd control methods were used to disperse the protesters. Several people were left with minor injuries and were attended to by emergency services,&#8221; he said.SAPS spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said commuters were at it again this morning, throwing stones and debris at passing vehicles as a result of trains not being available for people to ravel to work.&#8220;Angry members also assaulted security personnel and police members before marching up to Dumisani Highway where they barricaded the road with burning tyres and hit passing cars with stones. A case of public violence and arson was opened at Greenwood Park SAPS for investigation. No arrest reported,&#8221; said Col Mbhele.

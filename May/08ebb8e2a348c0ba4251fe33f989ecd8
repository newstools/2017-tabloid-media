&nbsp;Stuart Marais is making a habit of winning mountain bike races this year with the latest victory coming in the Husqvarna Classic Mid-Illovo MTB Challenge and Trail Run on Sunday. In the main 60km race, the Howick mechanical engineer overcame a fall which could have proved costly, but he picked himself up and rode on to a solid three-minute win over defending champion, Mid-Illovo local Derrin Smith, who in turn was two minutes ahead of the in-form David Low.In the women s race, 16-year-old Tiffany Keep again showed her talent by winning her first attempt at the longer 60km event. The Thomas More College schoolgirl beat off the challenge of Christie-Leigh Hearder with veteran Natalie Bergstrom claiming third.Both Marais and Keep were full of praise for the route which has been designed and created by local farmer Bruce Smith with the help of other local farmers in the area. The trails were phenomenal, said Marais. They have obviously put in so much work on the course and they have made then absolutely stunning. I had a bit of a mishap on one of the bridges. My front wheel slipped out and I fell off as I was crossing it. Apart from that that I had a good ride and I felt really good. Keep said she really enjoyed the single track and it showed as she kept her older and more experienced rivals at bay on the fun-filled, but tough and testing course.In the 18km iNsingizi Trail Run Derek Wasserfall was dominant, outpacing Mark Mackenzie and Rhain Hoskins by almost three minutes despite a silly mistake which could have proved costly.Wasserfall, who also won the Husqvarna Mid-Illovo Trail Run in 2012, said he was impressed by the course, but also had to overcome some issues before claiming the win.In the women s trail run, Xoli Madida finished up just over two minutes ahead of Robyn Greyling and Wendy Mills.For the less serious riders and runners there was also the 45km Safire MTB race and a relatively gentle 18km Gwahumbe Family Ride as well as the 9km iNsingizi Trail Run.RESULTS:60km MTB&nbsp;&nbsp;Men&nbsp;:Stuart Marais (2:30:41); Derrin Smith (2:33:56); David Low (2:35:56); Brennan Anderson (2:36:21) and Komborero Bere (2:38:12).Women:&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffany Keep (2:56:04); Christie-Leigh Hearder (2:57:50); Natalie Bergstrom (3:01:15);18km Trail Run&nbsp;&nbsp;Men:Derek Wasserfall (1:24:33); Mark Mackenzie (1:27:12); Rhain Hoskins (1:27:22).Women:Xoli Madida (1:36:47); Robyn Greyling (1:39:06); Wendy Mills (1:42:16).Pics: Johan Pretorius

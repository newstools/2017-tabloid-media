A 24 year old man was rescued yesterday afternoon from underneath the Cannaught Bridge on Umgeni Rd, where he claimed to be stuck there for two days. Rescue Care, IPSS Medical and SAPS Search and Rescue were called to the scene by a passer-by on a boat who noticed the man in distress. An SAPS Search and Rescue officer made his way into the Umgeni River to obtain visuals on the victim while IPSS paramedics prepared a rescue roping system to gain access to the man. IPSS Paramedics and SAPS used a technical rope system to reach the man where they placed him in a specialised harness and then lowered him to safety. Once on the ground paramedics stabilised the dehydrated man before he was transported to a nearby hospital, said Rescue Care s operation manager Garrith Jamieson.The circumstances of how the man got to that position are unknown and police are investigating.

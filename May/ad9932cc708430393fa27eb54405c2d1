The King of Sportsbikes is coming to South Africa and will be available to test around the Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit at the end of this month.The long-awaited new Suzuki GSX-R1000A makes its first public appearance on local asphalt from 26 to 28 May at the South African Bike Festival and three units will be available for high-speed test rides on the track.The GSX-R1000A will also be on display at Suzuki s display stand inside the main exhibition centre, where it will share the stage with two other brand new bikes.All-new King of SportsbikesThe GSX-R1000A has been highly anticipated by sportsbike enthusiasts across the globe. It features a powerful 200 HP engine (149 kW) and a host of new engine technologies that Suzuki has adapted from its MotoGP programme.The long list of new technologies include Suzuki Racing Variable Valve Timing (SR-VVT), which increases high-end engine power without compromising mid-range torque and driveability, the much-lauded Suzuki Advanced Exhaust System (S-AES) and the ability to toggle engine mapping settings on the fly with the Suzuki Drive Mode Select (S-DMS) system. The new GSX-R1000A is worth the wait, says Stuart Baker, Sales Manager at Suzuki South Africa. I think riders are going to be surprised at the brutal, yet linear way the new engine delivers its power and the ease with which the new, more compact frame improves high-speed handling. First look at the new SV650 and GSX-250RSharing the limelight at Suzuki s main stand will be the brand-new 2017 Suzuki SV650 and GSX-250R. Both models arrive at the show shortly after their global unveiling and this will be the very first time that riders, enthusiasts and Suzuki dealers will see the bikes.The V-twin SV650 was well-received at its global launch as a return to the bike s original roots, while packing several technologies also seen on the GSX-R1000A. Included in the technologies on display are an Easy Start system and a Low-Speed Assist system that regulates engine power at commuting speeds for ease of use and improved driveability.The GSX-250R, in turn, will showcase its new design, its upgraded parallel-twin engine and its full-LCD instrument cluster.Suzuki to also display cars, marine gearMoving from two wheels to four, Suzuki will also show its funky compact crossover, the Suzuki Ignis for the first time at the show. The Ignis combines Suzuki s compact car expertise with its off-road knowledge to offer customers the best of both worlds.Suzuki Marine will in turn show why it is the global leader in four-stroke outboard motors. At the Marine stand, the team will have several boats from Mariners Hub, different outboard motors and a special Suzumar inflatable.The SA Bike Show is be open to the at the Kyalami International Grand Prix Circuit.

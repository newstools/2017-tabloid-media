Underberg Local wildlife ranger Thabo Madlala realised his dream of winning the Giants Cup trail run over the weekend as he and seasoned ultra-athlete Su Don-Wauchope wrapped up the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s titles on the 30km final stage.The trail runners enjoyed sublime weather conditions, with snow blanketing the top of the Drakensberg mountains, as the pair extended the leads they had established on the first stage on the closing leg from Castleburn Farm to the Bushman&#8217;s Nek hotel.&#8220;I am so excited, so excited,&#8221; said an elated Madlala at the finish. &#8220;This is a race that I have always wanted to win, and today my dream came true,&#8221; said the 35-year-old Himeville local, who said that he was using the race as a crash course training session for the Comrades Marathon.The title is doubly significant for Madlala, who works for the Endangered Wildlife Trust on their African Crane Conservation project, as a significant amount of money is donated from the proceeds of the event to his Endangered Wildlife Trust and the Southern Drakensberg branch of Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, which is based at Cobham Nature Reserve.For Don-Wauchope, who was never under any pressure to win the women&#8217;s race, the trail run reaffirmed her love of running in the mountains, as she relished her recovery from the ankle injury the has kept her sidelined for an extended period.&#8220;Day Two of a multi-stage race is always hard, but once I loosened up, I could start to enjoy the run,&#8221; said Don-Wauchope, who was supported by her husband Iain Don-Wauchope, who is recovering from medical complaints of his own.&#8220;The first fifteen kays were beautiful and so runnable. Then from Swiman onwards it became a little more tricky and harder, just when your legs are starting to feel a bit tired. All and all it was a beautiful day on these glorious trails,&#8221; she said.Don-Wauchope said that the conservation message behind the event was made even more significant by the sighting of wildlife during the trail run.Pics: Greg Labuschagne / Anton Grote / Gameplan Media

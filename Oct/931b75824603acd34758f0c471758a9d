Retaining the blue flag status for two Durban Beaches will keep tourists coming in, thereby creating more jobs to contribute to the DGP, this, according to Councillor Geoff Pullan. Pullan was talking to Tabloid Newspapers after the announcement that was made on Wednesday, 4 October in the Eastern Cape that both uShaka which form part of the Golden Mile beach and Westbrook beach were being re-awarded their blue flag status. He said that as the city they are very delighted as tourism brings major businesses in the city. “I personally would have loved to have more blue flag beaches but uMhlanga and eMdloti Beaches could not qualify this year due to renovations that were undertaken during the assessment period.” He said that blue flag status is internationally recognised and the programme offers many benefits including the improved tourism facilities, enhanced management of coastal ecosystems, increased awareness of the coast and capacity building of the area.
“One of our biggest problem is the water quality and contamination from storm water drains.” A blue flag is an international award given annually to beaches that meet a standard of excellence in the areas of safety, amenities, cleanliness, and environmental management. South Africa is just one of 40 countries internationally which participates in the programme, with KZN’s tally of beaches now joining 4300 others globally to be recognised for their beauty and excellence.

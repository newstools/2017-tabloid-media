In celebration of the National Feral Cat Day that is observed annually on 16 October, Compass Cares launched a stunning wall calendar featuring gorgeous feral or previously stray cats. The launch is in support of a local non-profit organization – Cats of Durban – for the sterling work they do. The 2018 kitten edition calendar is available at an affordable price and all money raised goes towards Cats of Durban’s sterilisation project that costs about R500 per cat.
National Feral Cat Day aims to raise awareness about stray and feral cats and the need to trap and sterilise them in order to reduce the number of abandoned and unwanted kittens. The campaign also recognises the millions of people and organisations worldwide that care, manage and feed feral, stray and abandoned cats. Cats of Durban calendar ambassadors include Alice Leah of the A-List with her Ethan; Liesl Coppin, a Durban actress, singer, voice over artist, long distance runner with her two kids Joshua and Leah Laurenz; fashion designer Kathrin Kidger and her daughter, Reine and son Cruz.

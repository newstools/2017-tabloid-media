Creating hope and seeing women, men and children being empowered is the best part about Reverend Tanelle Welff-Dixon work. Welff-Dixon, who is a social justice activist, business woman and international motivational speaker, recently received a humanitarian award from President Jacob Zuma, the chairperson of the Matomela Trust. The uMhlanga Rocks resident, who is originally from Kraaifontein in Cape Town, told Durban North News that she was not seeking fame or awards with the work that she does in the community. “My goal is simply to use my life experience as a survivor of abuse to empower women and who may have come through similar experiences. Naturally, I am ecstatic to have received the award from President Zuma’s Matomela Trust in recognition for my efforts. I thank God for his mercy and blessings,” she said. Welff-Dixon has been a social activist for over 20 years, since she was molested and abused at a very young age. “Despite these challenges I become a photo-journalist, spent time in the South African Airforce, became a businesswoman and later went into ministry work in South Africa and the USA. I have been an active activist for social justice in various communities both in SA and in the USA where I lived for several years,” she said. She said being an international motivational speaker, preacher and social entrepreneur has helped her to mitigate some challenges but she has accepted that there will always be challenges and overcoming them creates character.

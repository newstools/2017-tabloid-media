Please note that following the severe storm that lashed the KwaZulu-Natal coast today (Tuesday 10 October 2017) and which caused severe flood damage, there have been rumours that the M41 bridge has collapsed. This is not true. The Mt Edgecombe Interchange (where the N2 and M41 intersect) has been inspected by site engineers and no structures have been found to have collapsed. However, according to the South African National Roads Agency SOC Limited (SANRAL) Eastern Region project manager for the Mt Edgecombe Interchange, Corné Roux, a cut face on the M41 between the Mt Edgecombe Interchange and the new Flanders Drive Interchange (where the new Flanders Drive on-ramp goes onto the M41), did collapse onto the M41, closing part of the M41 East bound. The actual road is, however, intact and will be reopened once debris has been cleared. Motorists are urged to proceed with caution and adhere to speed limits. The patience and co-operation of motorists will be appreciated. SANRAL apologises to the motoring public for any inconvenience caused and thanks them for their patience during road construction.

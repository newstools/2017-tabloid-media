A 59-year old man, alleged to be a drug dealer, suffered a brutal death after he was run over by a goods train near Frasers in Tongaat on Saturday. According to Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) boss, Prem Balram, at approximately 1:52pm, reaction officers were called out to the scene after receiving a call from a member of public reporting the incident. “Upon arrival, the elderly man was found to have suffered life-threatening injuries and died on scene. His injuries included a severed leg, multiple broken bones and a head injury,” said Balram. He added, “Witnesses used the deceased’s cellphone and contacted his sister who arrived a short while later. She informed Reaction Officers that her brother is a resident of Shakas Head which is situated on the north coast of KZN. “She claimed that he regularly travels to Frasers where he purchases marijuana which he resells in his community.
“It was not established if the deceased attempted to commit suicide or if he failed to hear the approaching train. “Witnesses claim that he was seen sitting on the railway line minutes before he was killed. An investigation into the death is currently underway,” said Balram.

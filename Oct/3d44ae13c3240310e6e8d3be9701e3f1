The South African Post Office urges customers who wish to mail Christmas parcels to all destinations to do so now. In particular, customers who use surface mail to send their Christmas gifts abroad, should do so soon as this will ensure that the parcel reach their destinations in time for Christmas.
The Post Office advised that Air Mail items should be sent by 8 December while Surface Mail destinations vary. Items going to the United Kingdom, Europe, Middle East, North America, The Seychelles, Comoros, Mauritius and Réunionshould be sent by 27 October while gifts to be sent to New Zealand, East and West Africa, Madagascar, Angola, Malawi, Zambia can go off on 1 December and items off to Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe can be sent by 8 December. Registered items can be insured against non-delivery, but not damage. This is due to the fact that the Post Office does not have control over the contents of a package, or the packaging material used and cannot accept responsibility for possible breakage. Useful hints:
½ Parcels must be packaged securely, as they are transported in bulk.
½ If your mail item does not fill the container, fill it with packaging material like shredded paper or polystyrene to act as a shock absorber.
½ Make sure the items you are sending are legal in the country of destination. In most countries, plant and animal material cannot be imported. The following items may not be posted:
½ Illegal items such as drugs.
½ Items that could leak and damage other packages, such as liquids.
½ Items that may explode or catch fire during air transport, such as aerosols or flammable liquids.
All international and Speed Services items are x-rayed and scanned to make sure the content is legal and safe.

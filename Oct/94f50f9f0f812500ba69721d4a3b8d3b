The police have warned motorists to be extremely careful on the R614 between Tongaat and Esenembe, especially when making u-turns. This warning comes after ten people, including two young children, were injured in a collision between a taxi and a light motor vehicle last Saturday. Tongaat police communications officer, Captain Patrick Ngwane said that the police have warned motorists several times to be careful on the roads. “We have asked people not to make u-turns just anywhere and when it is not guaranteed as safe. It is unfortunate that so many people were injured during the collision. We are yet to find the cause of the accident,” said Ngwane. Paramedics from Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) were at the scene to assist. Said Prem Balram: “Upon arrival officers found that a White Toyota Quantum that was travelling on the R614 from Tongaat towards Esenembe had collided with a VW Polo Vivo.” Paramedics from various private services treated the patients, including a three-year-old boy and five-year-old girl. “According to witnesses it is alleged that the VW Polo made a u-turn on the R614 directly into the travel path of the taxi. The taxi was unable to avoid the light motor vehicle and collided into the right rear before overturning,” added Balram.

A Belgian tourist had to be rescued after collapsing during a mountain hike on the northern side of the Drakensberg mountains. Okhahlamba Search and Rescue’s Freddy Hallgreen and disaster volunteer paramedic Steven Ricket were especially flown from Ladysmith to Dragon’s Peak by Westline Aviation to conduct to rescue last week. Despite strong winds the chopper managed to land in the mountains where the rescue team made it down to the point where the tourist was lying. The Belgian was airlifted and then taken to the Ladysmith High School where the InnovaMed Ambulance Service were on standby to take him to the Lenmed La Verna Hosital Hallgreen said that the patient was in a stable condition. A usual sleepy afternoon in Ladysmith turned out to be filled with excitement as the chopper landed on the school grounds as spectators watched the patient being transferred to the ambulance, along with an awaiting medical team.

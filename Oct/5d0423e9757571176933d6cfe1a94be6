Davenport Square, Glenwood, hosted the Davenport Square CANSA Shades of Pink for the first time this year on Sunday, 15 October 2017. The event was a great success, starting at 7:30am with registration and the actual run at 8am. Shades of Pink was created to raise awareness on cancer and to encourage people to live healthy, eat healthy and keep active. Within the race two inspirational ladies were spotted, one of which was a 74-year-old grandmother who completed the race despite a hip condition which she will be undergoing an operation for in the weeks to follow. The second lady was a 70-year-old who was a bubble of freshness, keeping all entertained.
Also present at the run was a breast cancer survivor who beat the illness and participated in the run with strength and agility. Organisers were very pleased with the outcome of the event and happy with the feedback received. Next year they aim to make it an even bigger event.

A crocodile about 1.5 meters in length was seen basking in the sun next to a large pond at the Amanzimnyama Park along the Old Mill Road in Tongaat. Last Sunday, a jittery member of the community spotted the reptile and immediately called Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) for help. Meanwhile, Captain Patrick Nqwane, Tongaat police’s communications officer urged to community not to go near the pond. He said that they were waiting the animal sanctuary to investigate the area in an attempt to remove the crocodile from the pond. Rusa’s Prem Balram said that when reaction officers arrived the crocodile slipped back into the water. “An animal sanctuary has been contacted to assist in the removal of the reptile. It has not been established at this stage as to where the reptile had come from.”

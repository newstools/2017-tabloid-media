A woman was killed and six others injured following a serious collision at the corner of Leopald Street and Grey Street on Sunday afternoon. Rescue Care Operations Director, Garrith Jamieson said, “Just after 5pm, Rescue Care Paramedics arrived on scene to find chaos. Three vehicles had collided in the junction before losing control and colliding into two pedestrians on the road side. One pedestrian had sustained critical injuries and Advanced Life Support worked to stabilise her on the scene. She was placed on a manual ventilator on the scene. “Unfortunately, her condition deteriorated and the patient went into cardiac arrest. Tragically, despite attempts by paramedics to resuscitate the patient, she passed away. A further six people had sustained various injuries and were also stabilised on the scene before being transported to various hospitals for further care.” It is believed that the deceased was a nursing member of staff at City Hospital. Jamieson added that police were on scene and will be investigating further.

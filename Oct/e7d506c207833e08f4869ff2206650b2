The Grade 2 learners at St Benedict School in Pinetown have spent the third term learning all about different modes of transport and ended off by looking at the various emergency services. In order to conclude the theme, a visit was arranged to the Pinetown Fire Station. The learners heard all about the equipment used by the fire-fighters, including the Jaws of Life, and were taught how to react in various emergency situations, including “Stop, drop and roll”.

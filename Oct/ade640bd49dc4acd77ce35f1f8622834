Durban Mayor Zandile Gumede, Deputy Mayor Fawzia Peer, Isipingo Councillor Sunil Brijmohan together with a contingent of department heads and councillors have donned overalls and gloves and are leading by example during a Clean-Up Operation in Isipingo and Durban South areas today. The area was ravaged by the storm which tore through Durban exactly one week ago. The devastating storm left death and destruction in its wake and Mayor Gumede has pledged support to ensure that disaster victims are assisted. The Mayor is calling on communities to help each other during this time of rebuilding.

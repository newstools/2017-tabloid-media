A man, believed to be in his 30s, narrowly escaped critical injuries when he plunged several metres from a vessel in the dry dock in Bayhead on Thursday. Netcare 911 media liaison officer, Nick Dollman said, “Netcare 911 responded to reports that a man had fallen from a vessel in the dry dock in Bayhead, Durban. Reports from the scene allege that the man fell several metres from the ship. He was attended to by a Netcare 911 Advanced Life Support paramedic and treated for a fracture to his lower leg. “Analgesic medication was administered to reduce the amount of pain that he was experiencing.

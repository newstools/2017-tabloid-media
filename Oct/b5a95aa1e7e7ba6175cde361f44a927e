The Democratic Alliance in KwaZulu-Natal is extremely concerned by the dereliction of duties by the ANC in the province with the ongoing cancellation of portfolio committee meetings, oversight visits and sittings now reaching unprecedented levels. The DA regards this as a direct result of a provincial leadership that is in tatters and is unable to deal with factionalism, corruption
and the endemic looting that is tearing it apart. This while ANC members of the provincial legislature are more interested in holding onto their positions than serving the people. If ever there was a barometer to measure citizen satisfaction in our province then it is service delivery protests. It would not be out of place to say that it is at an all-time low with the issue of housing featuring prominently as the KZN Department of Human Settlement battles to meet the demand. The recent violent protest by the Mariannhill community is a case in point. Now the eThekwini municipality has promised to build houses while MEC Ravi Pillay also promised to build 500 houses in Phoenix just before the local government elections. The community is still waiting. Meanwhile, land invasions and the failure by municipalities to stop them remain a major concern as do illegal allocations with allegations of patronage, allocations by ANC councillors and corruption rife. Add to this the issue of title deeds, with the eThekwini municipality promising to issue 5 000 title deeds within the next six months. It will be interesting to see whether these and more promises will be delivered on as we head towards a national elections in the next 18 months. The DA is committed to holding the MEC, his Department and KZNâ€™s municipalities accountable. George Mari, MPL

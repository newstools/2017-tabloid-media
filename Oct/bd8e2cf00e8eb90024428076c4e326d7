A freak accident claimed the life of a 63-year-old man while parking his car at his garage at home, last Saturday in Verulam. The man, who has not been identified, apparently knocked into a supporting concrete beam of the house causing the roof to collapse on top of his vehicle. According to Reaction Unit South Africa’s Prem Balram, the man died after a wooden beam penetrated his chest, pinning him against the seat of his car. “Rusa members were called out to the home by the victim’s family reporting a structural collapse. Firemen from the uMhlanga Fire and Rescue Services cut the beam with a saw to free the deceased from the vehicle,” said Balram.

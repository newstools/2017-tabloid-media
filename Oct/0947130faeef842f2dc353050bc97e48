Community based organisation, 3 Kings Foundation embarked on a wheelchair drive to assist members of the community who don’t have the means to purchase their own wheelchairs. The organisation recently put smiles on the faces of Phoenix residents when the members donated much needed wheelchairs to the sickly and physically impaired. Speaking to the Phoenix Tabloid, chairman of the organisation, Ashwin Singh said, “3 Kings Foundation is a non-profit organisation with a vision to provide a platform of hope and inspiration to people facing socio-economic problems in our society. This wheelchair drive is a project which is very personal to me. I have also been confined to one room, dependent on somebody to help me and did not have a wheelchair. “I know these wheelchairs will restore new faith in life and a feeling of independence for our recipients. This will make a world of difference in their lives.” “I would like to thank our sponsors, who contributed towards helping us reach our goals as an organisation thus far. “We will be donating 13 more wheelchairs, later on in October. 3 Kings Foundation serves to help our impoverished communities in anyway possible – it is an organisation that people can believe in and count on. “I am proud to be part of this initiative, knowing that we are helping to make a positive impact in our society. Remember, a hand that gives is worth more than a hand that prays,” said Singh. “Our goal as an organisation is to alleviate these socio-economic problems by providing care and support to vulnerable children and pensioners in destitute areas, through networking, alliances with local businesses, other non-profit organisations and through fundraising,” added Singh.

Marriam Shaik of Asherville, Durban celebrated her 100th birthday in style, with a surprise party from hospital staff on Thursday, 28 September. Due to the unexpected deterioration in her optical condition, Shaik was admitted to Lenmed Health Shifa Hospital in Sydenham by Dr MI Motala on Thursday, 21 September. It was however not all doom and gloom for Shaik as the Hospital Management had better plans in mind for her. A surprise birthday party was co-ordinated by Ms S Asmal, PRO and Matron
S Nepaul, and Shaik’s
ward resonated with song while family members lifted Shaik’s spirits. The ward was decorated with multi-coloured helium balloons, floral arrangements and
a tea trolley with a chocolate cake with a single candle lit up the day. Asmal presented a gift to the Shaik on behalf of management and Shaik had nothing but praises for all the nursing staff who cared for her during her 10 day stay.
Even the hospital’s pharmacists surprised her with more balloons and a pretty bouquet of flowers. Shaik’s father came from India to South Africa in 1910. She is the fourth eldest of 16 siblings.
The average age of her surviving seven siblings is 87 years and she is a mother of seven children, 19 grandchildren and 34 great-grandchildren. Her health tip is to stick to fresh, natural foods and a fat-free, minimal oil diet. She does not eat what she calls “cafe food” (fast food) or processed meat products. Ironically her favourite line is “life is very short”.

The 11th annual higher education conference took place from 27-29 September at the Elangeni Hotel on Durban’s beach front. The conference boasted several keynote speakers, various plenary seminars as well as workshops across 11 themes including “Decolonisation and the Transformation of the Curriculum,” “Governance and Leadership in Higher Education,” and “Reclaiming the Arts in Higher Education.” Acting Deputy Vice- Chancellor for Teaching and Learning at UKZN, Professor Bala Pillay said that Higher Education Institutions are grappling with the challenges of developing a locally relevant curriculum that embraces international best practices. Madelein Merring from Mc Graw Hill Education had travelled down from Pretoria to attend the conference. “We Invest in developing learning technology products and we came to inform instructors about how the platform can enhance teaching and learning,” said Merring.
Nicholas West from The University of Witwatersrand said the conference showed educators how to enhance their teaching methods. “We are all interested in higher education effectively and the conference is about finding out about different ways of enhancing teaching to help our students,” said West. The conference provided an important platform for discussions around academia and teaching within a higher education sphere.

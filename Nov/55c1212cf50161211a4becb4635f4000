The chef sister act of Zainab and Faatimah Paruk from Durban’s gourmet catering company, Chilli Chocolate Chefs, were awarded as the winners of Roshgold’s Young Business Achiever Awards. With over 62 diverse entries received from all over young businesses in South Africa, the esteemed panel of judges had their hands full to whittle the list down to the top 20 and further reduce this to the top 5. All were invited for the final round in Johannesburg at Roshgold’s AGM. Roshgold Chairman, Ebrahim Sujee said, “The Roshgold Young Business Achiever Awards was set up to recognise young entrepreneurs for their initiative, perseverance and risk taking. Many of the entrants demonstrated their abilities to create sustainable enterprises leveraging technology, social media and using multiple platforms. They demonstrated their understanding of their social responsibility and the needs of the underprivileged by providing supporting information on what they and their business have done for the needy.” An exciting finish to the awards saw the Chilli Chocolate Chef team scoop the
winners award. They walked away with an Apple Macbook, cash from Al Baraka Bank, Life Coaching from Razia Mohamed amongst other smaller prizes. An excited Chef Zainab announced on their social media page: “We are honoured and humbled to be recognised by Roshgold in the Young Business Achiever Awards and would like to thank our clients, staff, suppliers, friends and family. If it was not for your support this award would not be possible.” She also went on to thank Roshgold and the sponsors for holding this initiative and providing the platform for young businesses to be showcased.

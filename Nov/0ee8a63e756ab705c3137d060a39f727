Speaking on the tournament, chairperson of SAFA Chatsworth Nelson Spinx Kuppen said, “This tournament has become much vaunted in the calendar by our clubs and is proudly sponsored by Mr Colin Naidoo in memory of his late son Tyran Naidoo. The entire Football fraternity is extremely grateful to Mr Naidoo and the rest of the DPG Logistics team for their generous sponsorship in the development of Junior Football in Chatsworth. It is through the tireless efforts of people like Mr Naidoo that hundreds of young aspiring footballers from our sprawling township have the opportunity to participate in the beautiful game.”
“Football is a global unifying force which brings people of all walks of life together and Chatsworth is no exception. The participation of children in sport, especially football is essential in their physical, psychological and academic growth; to this end we are truly grateful to the benevolence of people like Colin Naidoo and his dedicated DPG Logistics team for their unwavering support of football development in Chatsworth. We therefore would like families to come out and support our young stars and let’s make this a family fun day to remember with football as the centre piece,” added Kuppen.

On Sunday, 18 June, Father’s Day will be celebrated in honour of the fathers in our lives, our families, our communities and in our nation. It is a day to recognise the contribution that fathers and father figures offer by way of guidance, support, love and protection. Pictured is Sgt Sebelo Xaba from the Umlazi SAPS K9 Unit who will not only be celebrated by his beautiful twin daughters, Sanelisiwo and Sinothando but also by his police dog, Erica and the community for being a protector in the communities he serves daily. The editor, management and staff of Southern Star wish all fathers a Happy Father’s Day.

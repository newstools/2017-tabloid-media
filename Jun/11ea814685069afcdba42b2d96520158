By Krishnee Naidoo Swift police work led to a nine-month-old Phoenix baby being found more than a week after he was kidnapped by a woman, known to the baby’s mother. On Sunday, baby Olwethu Gift Nojahi from Mount Moriah was found safe and unharmed. Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said, “The nine-month-old baby was found alive and was taken to a place of safety after members were searching for her since she disappeared. A suspect was arrested and charged for kidnapping.” The suspect was to appear in the Verulam Magistrates’ Court, yesterday. According to police, it is alleged that on 3 June 2017, the mother of the baby was at her place of residence when her friend Zanele Mchunu (17)  came to her house. “The friend asked to borrow her baby since she was going to a mall. They both went away but they did not return home,” said Cpt Gwala. Missing persons reports were circulated extensively and police searched intensely for the missing baby. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Cpt L Naidoo, said, “A plan was set in place to nab the suspect who kidnapped the baby. Observation was kept and the suspect was apprehended. She led police to the baby thereafter.”

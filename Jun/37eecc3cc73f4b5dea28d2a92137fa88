“Happy Fathers Day means more than have a happy day. It means I love you first of all, then thanks for all you do. It means you mean a lot to me, and that I honor you.” – anon Sunday is Father’s Day. This special day is about commemorating the often unsung family heroes in the community. The dads (and single mums) who are there to look after, provide for, love and nurture their families. Father’s Day is about acknowledging that unconditional love and saying ‘thank you dad’. Staff at The Westville Gazette join Kevin and Jordan Poulter, staff and learners of St Benedict School in wishing all the dads a happy Father’s Day.

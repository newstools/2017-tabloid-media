 This weekend will see thousands of women, and a few brave men, take to the roads in participation of the Durban SPAR Women’s 10/5km Challenge. Taking place tomorrow Sunday, 11 June, the race starts in Masabalala Yengwa Avenue at 8am and finishes at the Growthpoint Kings Park outer fields, where there will be live music to entertain finishers and supporters.

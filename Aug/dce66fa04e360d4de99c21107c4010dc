 Two suspects posing as water meter readers allegedly assaulted a domestic worker and gardener in O’Connor Place in La Lucia on Thursday, 27 July. The two suspects ran off with an undisclosed number of items from the house. Marshall Security was called by one of the neighbors reporting a robbery in progress. According to Marshall Security’s Kyle van Reenen the two suspects managed to flee before reaction officers made it to the house. “They rushed to the scene and found the workers to have suffered minor injuries only and were assessed on scene by Crisis Medical Paramedics. We secured the scene and handed over to the South African Police Services for further investigation and processing,” said van Reenen.

A pair of black bedroom slippers was lying next to my bed and to my surprise I found a person in my bed, the entire body and head was covered with my blanket. I picked up the blanket and found the dead body of a woman. Her head was covered with a black plastic bin bag.” He said that he then called the police. “Someone else was going pass and he also called emergency services. An ambulance service was at the cemetery at the time and assisted us. The Umbilo police came to the scene and handled things from there.” Umbilo police communications officer, Captain Pumzile Makaula, confirmed the incident.

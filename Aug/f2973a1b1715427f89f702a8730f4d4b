During the same period 284 arrests was made as a result of investigations by the team. Accused that were on trial during the same period was sentenced to six terms of life imprisonment and a total of 431 years in prison. The six men who were sentenced to life imprisonment was as a result of rape incidents that occurred in Mariannhill, KwaMakhutha, Newcastle, Osizweni, Bishopstowe and Wartburg. The accused cannot be named since their victims are children and related to them, said Zwane.The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, congratulated the FCS units in the province for their perseverance in putting rapists behind bars. &#8221;I am pleased with this news as it comes at a time when we are advocating against the culture of gender violence.I hope that this sends a clear message to those who abuse our women and children. We also wish to thank all role players in the criminal justice system for their part in securing these convictions. We hope that those who have been arrested last month will face a similar fate soon,&#8221; he said.

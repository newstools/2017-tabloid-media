The trial of the Havenside father accused of raping two of his daughters (9 and 15) will commence at the Durban Regional Court on Thursday, August 10. Chatsworth FCS (Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences) Unit Commander Col. K.S Ellappan stated, “The nine-year old child endured abuse from her father from the age of 7 when he began touching and kissing her inappropriately. “On Wednesday, 1 March, he held her down on the bed and raped her. The child told the teacher at school who reported the incident to the police. The father was then arrested.” The child’s 15-year old sister later claimed that she was also raped by their father and a second charge of rape was added to the case. The two children were removed from their mother’s custody shortly after the man was arrested, and are still in a place of safety. The 50-year old accused is still in police custody and is detained at Westville Prison.

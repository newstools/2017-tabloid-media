There’s nothing quite like a beautiful Sunday morning spent at Durban’s iconic Moses Mabhida Stadium, coupled with delicious snacks and Durban’s finest super cars.  On Sunday, 30 July, at least 50 super cars participated in the much-anticipated, IBV Supercar Club Breakfast Run. Moses Mabhida Stadium served as the venue to host a number of South Africa’s top super cars. The super-hot convoy included Maseratis, Porsches, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Aston Martins and more, made their way along the beautiful scenic midlands route towards Pietermaritzburg. The IBV Super Car Club, a division of IBV International vaults, is a world renowned, exclusive members-only club that aims to unite super car owners across the globe. This club made history by achieving a Guinness World Record for the most money raised in a super car parade when they raised over R1 million through a super car parade of 211 vehicles in Durban.

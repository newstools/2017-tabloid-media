A case of attempted murder is being probed by Phoenix police after a roadworks employee was shot at by an enraged motorist as a result of flying debris which struck his vehicle at the site of the Mount Edgecombe Interchange project, last Thursday morning. It is believed that the complainant was operating a machine on the roadside that caused a stone to strike the motorist’s vehicle.
“The driver of the vehicle stopped and the complainant went to the vehicle to ascertain the damages to that vehicle. The driver of the vehicle produced a firearm and pointed it at the complainant. “The driver then fired two shots at the complainant who managed to hide behind his machine. The driver thereafter fled from the scene. The complainant managed to obtain the registration plates of the fleeing vehicle and a case of attempted murder is being investigated,” said Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Cpt L Naidoo.
In a separate attempted murder case, a 23-year-old man was arrested after he allegedly ran over a victim stemming from an altercation earlier in the day. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Cpt L Naidoo said, “Keshav Nagashar was detained by police members in respect of an attempted murder incident which unfolded in Atholpark in Sastri Park, last Sunday. A witness alleged that the suspect knocked over the victim. “It is further alleged that the suspect and the victim were involved in an altercation prior to the ramming incident. The suspect is believed to have followed the victim and then rammed into him. The victim sustained head injuries and was transported to hospital. The accused appeared in the Phoenix Magistrates Court last Monday.”

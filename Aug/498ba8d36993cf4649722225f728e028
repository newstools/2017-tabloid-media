The police in KwaZulu-Natal are warning members of the community in Durban and surrounding areas to be aware of the resurgence of a modus operandi used by criminals to commit robberies. Homeowners have been robbed of their household items and other valuables by criminals who pretend to be municipal or Telkom employees. Police spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said, “A group of four or five males, wearing municipal or Telkom work wear, as well as, reflector jackets, and mostly travelling in a Hyundai H100 pickup truck or a bakkie approach homes, pretending to be there for meter readings or any other maintenance purposes.  As soon as the occupants open the gate for them, they hold them up at gunpoint and rob them of valuables.” He added, “The community is warned to be aware of such criminals. Municipal employees do not come in groups when conducting meter readings and they are usually on foot. No Telkom employee will come into your house if you have not reported any fault with their customer services. Communities must always be alert and should not allow strangers into their homes. Homeowners must ensure that they educate their family members as well as their domestic employees to always be cautious. If one is suspicious of people at your property, you should request them to produce their identification cards and verify it with the relevant authorities.”

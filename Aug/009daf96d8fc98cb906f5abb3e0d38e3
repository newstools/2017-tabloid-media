The trial of the brutal rape and murder of three-year old ‘Baby Jamie’ resumed on Monday,  31 July at the Durban High Court and saw the child’s mother being questioned extensively about a car accident in 2001. According to court reports, her attorney Murray Pitman is arguing that she does not have the mental capacity to be held criminally responsible for her actions as a result of the crash. A neuro-psychologist was called to give testimony on the mother’s assessment. The toddler was found raped and killed in her Havenside home in 2014 sparking a public outcry. The mother is on trial along with the child’s grandmother.

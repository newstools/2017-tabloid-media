A group of alleged hijackers, who were terrorising the community of Umlazi and the surrounding areas, were arrested on Wednesday by determined and committed members from the eThekwini Outer South Cluster and other role-players. Six suspects were traced and arrested while they were at Folweni and Umlazi. They were linked to three hijackings that were reported over two days at Folweni, Umlazi and Bhekithemba. The arrested suspects are to appear in the Umlazi Magistrates’ Court soon facing charges of hijacking, kidnapping and possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said, “Police officials from the eThekwini Outer South Cluster detected a trend of hijacking of vehicles in their area. A multi-disciplinary intelligence driven operation was conducted by various units following up on leads with regards to the identity of the suspects. Their operations yielded positive results when they bust the gang and arrested all of them. The arrested suspects might be linked to a number of other hijackings reported in and around Durban. A number of hijacked vehicles were recovered.
“An unlicensed 9mm pistol, as well as a toy gun believed to be the same used during the commission of crimes was recovered from the suspects. Some of the stolen property from the victims of crime was also recovered such as a wristwatch, car keys, cellphones and liquor. In two of the hijackings, the victims were forced to drive away with the suspects and they were dropped off at Z section in Umlazi area.” The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa praised the members for the arrest and the recovery of hijacked vehicles. “This is a significant breakthrough and I applaud all those who worked jointly to bust this gang. We are however not relaxing as there is still a lot that needs to be done to break the back of other gangs that are still operating in our space,” he said.

Captain Pillay joined the South African Police Service in December 1990 serving as a police officer in this organisation for the past two and a half decades in the communities of Soweto, Lenasia, Bayview and Malvern. Captain Pillay, who currently serves as the Communications Officer at South African Police Services Chatsworth for the past five years, has been a forerunner in the fight against crime.

Captain Pillay, who serves on the various committees, believes that she is strategically placed with the vision to developing a professional cadre of women who are empowered and will be able to contribute effectively towards quality service delivery.

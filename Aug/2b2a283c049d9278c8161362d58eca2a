By Janice Pillay Four armed suspects were apprehended in the Bayview area following an attempted hijacking on Tuesday, 29 August. Bayview SAPS Communications Officer Colin Chetty stated that at about 12pm, members of Malvern SAPS Cst N Moodley and Cst L Govender were patrolling the Croftdene area when they noticed a suspicious motor vehicle, a white Sandero with four suspects. Cst Govender and Cst Moodley tried to stop the vehicle but the occupants in the white Sandero increased their speed.

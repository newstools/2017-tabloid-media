By Krishnee Naidoo Complaints from some parents of their primary school children being bullied and assaulted allegedly by high school learners within the Grove-end area resulted in an operation being put into place that saw six learners caught for being in possession of dagga on Friday.   “Members of the Rapid Response Team Phoenix (RRTP) conducted a patrol after receiving the complaints from worried parents. Whilst patrolling, RRTP members intercepted six learners on the Saccharine Grounds in Stanmore. The learners had in their possession dagga. They were taken back to school and together with the drugs they were handed over to the school principal who was pleased with the efforts of the RRTP team.”  “Ten learners were also caught for absconding and returned to school for disciplinary actions to be addressed with them,” said RRTP spokesman, Sunil Singh. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Cpt L Naidoo said, “Police have partnered with security companies in the area to curb crime. We are aware that security members have recovered drugs in the possession of learners. Further operations will ensue to weed out this problem affecting learners.” “We are pleased with the results from this initiative. Our youth are our future and need to be assisted to get back on track. Members of the RRTP informed all stakeholders of the situation between the learners and by taking quick action, the problem is being spotlighted and resolved,” said Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh.

Orchids, Staghorn Ferns, Cycads and Aloes will be sharing the spotlight with Bromeliads, Bonsai, Tillandsias and Heliconias, to name a few, at the Fairway Orchid and Rare Plant Fair to be held at 118 Fairway, Durban North on Saturday 12 August.  These plants will be on display, as well as for sale and various gardening demonstrations will be held throughout the day. The public will have the opportunity to view some beautiful prime species of orchids such as Cattleyas, Dendrobiums and Phalaenopsis (also known as moth orchids), displayed by members of The Natal Orchid Society. “Plant lovers will be treated to a fine display of plants, not just orchids,’ said Melanie van Greunen, organiser of this, the third Fairway Orchid and Rare Plant Fair. “There will be pruning, potting and mounting demonstrations held at various times with experts such as Hennie Steyn from Inhle Orchids, Geoff Gibson from Mighty Fine Orchids and Gordon Louw, President of the Natal Orchid Society who will be sharing loads of valuable advice on how to tend and look after the plants. These demonstrations have proved popular in previous years,” said Melanie. Vendors, including Gods Green Gifts (Indigenous), Plantae (Orchids and Bromeliads), Staghorn Ferns, Misty Moon (Bonsais), Rare and Air (Tillandsias) and Afri Orchids (Orchid Species), will have plants for sale and some beautiful specimens will be given away as raffle prizes. The Fair is open to the public from 9am until 4pm. Refreshments will be available with a tea garden serving coffee, tea, cake and light lunches all day. “This event is for young and old; an opportunity for all plant enthusiasts to enjoy a relaxed day in a beautiful setting,” added Melanie. “The venue is also wheelchair-friendly.” Entrance fee is R15 per person. Children under 12 are free. For further information contact Melanie van Greunen on 083 456 0178 or 031 563 7102 or email reservation@fairwaydurban.co.za

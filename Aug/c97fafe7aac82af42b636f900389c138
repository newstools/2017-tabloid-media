The Al Aqsa Group of Chatsworth held an awareness campaign on Saturday, 12 August to educate people of the recent events in Palestine. Moulana Saleem Abraham, who was the chief organiser of the event, stated that the Friday prayer was the most important gathering of the week for the entire Muslim population throughout the world. “The Israeli army installed metal detectors at the entrance of the mosque, something unheard of before. This incident did not go well for the Palestinians and Muslims globally as the Al Aqsa mosque is the third holiest mosque for the Islamic world. It’s the mosque that the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven and where he received the command of praying 5 times a day. “Our intentions are to have a dialogue with our South Africans and show them that there are always two sides to every story. Main stream media does not cover these issues. We have been living in peace with our fellow South Africans therefore we see it vital in talking with people,” said Ebrahim. “The placard demonstrations were peaceful and attended by many people from Chatsworth and surrounding areas. Points of demonstration were Mobeni Heights,  Westcliff shopping centre,  Moorton offramp and the Chatsworth Centre. “We wish to thank all who made the demonstration possible,” said Ebrahim.

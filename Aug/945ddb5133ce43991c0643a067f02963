Plans to crack down on the 286 staff members incited in admissions scams were revealed by the university of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) during a press conference at Westville Campus on Thursday, 3 August. While 286 staff could be implicated following a search and seizure operation, 18 staff have been suspended, one of whom was dismissed. “This investigation was a lengthy process as it was critical to ensure that all people implicated face the full might of the law, said UKZN Vice-Chancellor, Dr Albert van Jaarsveld. Aided by an external forensic audit company, investigations aimed to gauge the extent of staff infringements and gather evidence. Students on the campus expressed contempt at the scam. “I applied for medical school with an 83percent aggregate and didn’t get in,” said UKZN accounting student, Sabeeha Ally (19). “Students work hard for their places here and the university loses credibility through this,” she said. The unlikelyhood of scam success was also highlighted. “If you do that you are going to get caught,” said BCom student, Riyaad Ballim (18). Five students have been implicated in the scam.

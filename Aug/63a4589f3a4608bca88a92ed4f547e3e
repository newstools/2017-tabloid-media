By Danica Hansen The eThekwini Municipality hosted a march from the Durban City Hall to the Thokoza Hostel to commemorate Women s Day on Tuesday morning, 8 August. The march was led by the City Integrity and Investigations Unit to raise awareness of gender issues and women s rights. &#8220;This march that we are having today is to show that women&#8217;s rights are human rights, we believe that with all that is happening in the country, we need some people to vouch for and confirm that women&#8217;s right are equal to any other human being,&#8221; said Deputy Head City Integrity and Investigations Unit, Dumisani Cele. The unit is responsible for promoting respect for human rights within the municipality. They also investigate any conduct within the city that is deemed to be improper and result in prejudice, including maladministration, corruption, abuse of power, and unfair discrimination. &#8220;The bigger mandate comes from the office of the mayor, but we have to come up with initiatives,&#8221; said Cele. Various units, such as the health unit were to participate in the awareness march.

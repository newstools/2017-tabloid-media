A security officer is alleged to have shot dead a suspect who together with an accomplice allegedly attacked him at the Ottawa Railway Station on Tuesday. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) were called out to the scene after receiving reports of a shootout in progress. RUSA boss, Prem Balram said, “Upon arrival, the body of the suspect was found under a tree in an open field next to the Ottawa Cemetery. He had sustained a single gunshot wound to his chest and was declared deceased by medics. It is alleged that two suspects attacked the security officer, who is employed by a company based in Durban, at the Ottawa Railway Station. A foot chase ensued through the grave yard when the suspect attempted to shoot the pursuing officer. The security officer drew his company-issued revolver and shot the suspect in defence. The second suspect fled the scene. The SAPS Umhlali K9 Unit with the use of specialised dogs conducted an extensive search for the remaining suspect however he managed to evade arrest.”

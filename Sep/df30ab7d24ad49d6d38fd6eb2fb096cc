Mari Stella’s 10th Sunflower Fund Day raised R24 250 through the purchase of 970 Topes. The day was awash with fun fit for the ‘Mzanzi Magic’ theme. Each class in the prep and high school worked together to create imaginative outfits from SunflowerTopes, and Sabrina Maingard, aka, Fashion Nanny was there to judge. Mari Stella girls raised more funds as they sang at Emmanuel Cathedral’s Denis Hurely Centre on Wednesday, 20 September as part of an evening concert.

Drought remains a reality, and the community has been urged by the uThukela District Municipality to use water sparingly as water shedding is being implemented. About 40 percent of the Ladysmith water supply comes from the Klipriver, which has dried up due to low or no rainfall received in catchment areas. Water shedding was implemented on 15 September. Pressure will be decreased in the Van Riebeek and Roosboom areas while water will be cut from 8pm to 1pm the next day. According to the municipality, the shedding was dependent on water stock levels at the Ladysmith Plant. Water shedding will have major effect on the following areas: Golf course; Observation Hill; Hyde Park; Limit Hill; Model Kloof; St Chads and Steadville top. “The drought situation around uThukela District Municipality is getting worse. People are therefore encouraged to use water sparingly during this trying period,” said a spokesperson.

The nationwide Congress of South African Trade Union (COSATU) strike drew thousands to the DiniZulu Park in Durban on Wednesday, 27 September at around 10:30 am. The strike against state capture and corruption led protestors to the Durban City Hall to hand over a memorandum to the Premier. COSATU Provincial Secretary for KZN, Edwin Mkhize outlined some of the demands within the memorandum. “What we have in the memorandum are the demand of COSATU which are long standing demands banning the legal brokers and the scrapping of outsourcing. We also demand more employment to be created and we are fighting against the independent power producers,” said Mkhize. According to COSATU member, Zanele Dlamini, “The fight is not only for corruption in different departments but also about the state capture. As COSATU, we are here today to put an end to that today,” said Dlamini. Member of the South African Democratic Teachers union (SADTU), Jackson Mlambo said that the strike promoted equality and that only Cosatu could defend the working class employees. “Since SADTU is one of the biggest affiliations of COSATU, we are here today to fight against corrupt leaders and promote equality amongst everyone. Our state has been captured it keeps getting worse and as a country we need to put a stop to it. “We say ‘no’ to corrupt leaders, only COSATU members have the capacity to defend the working class from exploitation of employers and the state capture,” said Mlambo. Approximately 5 000 people joined the Durban strike in the morning, said Mkhize. Coherent strikes were set to take place in provinces across the country including Gauteng, Eastern Cape, Limpopo, Cape Town, Polokwane and Nelspruit.

Tim Plewman, by public demand, once again dons the Caveman’s skins and steps onto stage to add to his record breaking slew of sold out performances of the longest-running and most successful solo comedy in South African theatre history, as he returns to the Elizabeth Sneddon Theatre on UKZN campus in Durban to perform Defending the Caveman from 2 – 14 October. The Broadway production still holds the record of the longest running non-musical solo comedy of all time. This show humorously exposes the hunter and gatherer within the modern man. Penned by Rob Becker, Plewman adapted the script for Southern Africa and went on to win the Vita Award for Best Actor in a Comedy. Updated, upgraded the production is a hilarious, affectionate and insightful comedy that explains why men and women see the world so differently, and will have you looking at your partner with new eyes. After years of hearing that all men are “assholes,” the Caveman once again stands up to be counted. Tim has become one of the most sought after actors in SA, equally at home in drama or comedy.

Sibaya’s iZulu Theatre plays host to the glittering Mrs India South Africa pageant on Sunday, 8 October. The event, which serves as a platform for acknowledging the contribution that married, divorced and widowed Indian women make in their community, will once again feature dazzling fashion and spectacular live entertainment. This is the fourth time that the glamorous affair is being hosted at Sibaya, which shares the values of the Mrs India SA pageant CEO, Anusha Bisaal. “Women’s achievements and contribution to their families and communities often go unnoticed, and this event gives us an opportunity to celebrate and recognise their efforts and accomplishments. We are thrilled excited to provide the stage for the crowning of the new Mrs India SA,” says Janet Pillay, the PR and promotions manager at Sibaya. With much glitz and glamour, the pageant aims to promote women empowerment and wellbeing, as well as engage in social causes. The Mrs India SA pageant is open to the public. Tickets are available via Computicket, at Shoprite Checkers, and at the Sibaya Box Office. The show starts at 4pm.

After a gruelling three-year battle against Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia, 21-year old Tashnika Rambali succumbed to the illness on Monday evening.Tashnika was well known in the community for her assistance in creating awareness of blood and bone marrow donations, which are vital to treating cancer. Tashnika partnered up with both the Sunflower Fund and SANBS to help host these drives.With the support of her family, friends, and supporters from all over, Tashnika showed courage and strength, not only to fight for herself but for others.Prior to a blood and bone marrow drive in 2016, Tashnika posted her story on the Facebook page; Tashnika Rambalis Blood &amp; Bone Marrow Drives . Here she chronicles her fight with cancer since she was diagnosed in December 2013. Tashnika immediately started treatment, and after a year, she went into remission. This allowed her to further her education, thus she enrolled to study Bio Technolgy at the Durban University of Technology, but alas at the start of 2016, Tashnika was informed that she was in early relapse. This did not deter Tashnika, as she continued her search for a bone marrow match for a stem cell transplant.Towards the end of 2016, Tashnika found a stem cell donor match, and continued to show bravery and strength to the end.When news of her passing broke, condolences flooded in on social media, with friends family and supporters expressed their heartbreak at the loss. The funeral took place yesterday, at the Rambali&#8217;s residence in Merebank.

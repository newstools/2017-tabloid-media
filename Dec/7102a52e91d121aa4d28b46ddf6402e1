The kids got a chance to enjoy and feel the festivities of Christmas. “This project is close to all the hearts of the Rotaract Club as we have taken this orphanage under our wing and have a close relationship with the kids and caretaker of this remarkable establishment since 2010. We provided the kids with breakfast, snacks, treats and lunch. It was a fun filled day as we had entertainment, a jumping castle and games for the kids. To see these kidís faces light up with every activity on the day was the most heartwarming,” said the President of the club Taruna Ragubir The club does a monthly grocery drop off to the orphanage, the Rotaract Club of Verulam believes that Christmas is the time of giving and making a difference. “We believe that during this festive season, always think about the less fortunate.

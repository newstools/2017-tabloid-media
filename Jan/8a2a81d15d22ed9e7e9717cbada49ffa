KZN residents could face a 5 to 10 percent increase in water restrictions if there&#8217;s insufficient rainfall this year, according to Umgeni Water. Spokesperson for Umgeni Water, Shami Harichunder says at the moment the level of Midmar Dam is at 55%, and Albert Falls at 26%. This despite a 15% restriction in place in areas it supplies.Harichunder added that there isn&#8217;t enough water available to meet the demands of the uMgungundlovu District, Msunduzi Municipality and eThekwini Metro.&#8220;Consumers should bear in mind that the situation hasn&#8217;t quite improved yet. The need for greater water conservation is now imperative. No one should sit back and relax &#8211; thinking the worst is over. The worst is not over. If the rains do not come &#8211; we could be in for quite a tough ride in the next few months at least,&#8221; he said.

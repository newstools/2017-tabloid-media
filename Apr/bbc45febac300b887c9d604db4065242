The aQuell Tour Durban provides a route that is a fair test for both the top professional cyclists and the weekend warriors. Organisers are alerting the public to be aware of the road closures and to make use of alternative routes on Sunday morning, 30 April.The main event, the 105km road race that takes riders from the start at Moses Mabhida up to Pinetown and then back to the beachfront before riders head to Ballito and back, is mostly suited to the sprinters in the race for overall victory. However, there is enough climbing early on, combined with the rolling hills on the way to and from Ballito to ensure the sprinters cannot always guarantee victory.The biggest climb in the 105km ride is the relatively long ascent up the M7 (Edwin Swales) but it comes too early in the race to break up the professional bunch. The short climbs around Umdloti are more likely to create race deciding splits.Last year a small group broke away on the ride back from Ballito and were able to stay away to the end, allowing RoadCover&#8217;s Bradley Potgieter to get ahead of David Maree with Herman Fouch and Rohan Du Plooy following them across the line.&#8220;Every year the climbers try and attack on the climb up the M7 and try to hurt the sprinters,&#8221; said Cyclesphere&#8217;s Greg Albert, who usually watches the racing from up close and will once again be driving the neutral service car providing mechanical assistance to the leaders. &#8220;And as always I am sure the teams of the sprinters will try to keep it all together for their guys.&#8221;RoadCover will not have the numbers at the race this year, which will give Nolan Hoffman, Maree and their BCX teammates the advantage. With just a light breeze predicted, it seems likely BCX will be able to close down any breaks which probably make top sprinter Hoffman the man to beat.The 45km road race and 55km cyclocross events both follow a similar route to Umdloti and back, the only difference between the two being the off road mountain bike sections that are added in for the latter to make the cyclocross such a unique event.The cyclocross contains a few steep climbs on the dirt sections which will test the legs of most riders on their offroad bikes, but the 45km route is suited to those weekend warriors looking for a gentle ride along the scenic coast road.As always, the route will have full road closure which means riders only have to worry about other cyclists out on the course.The approximate road closures are as follows:

The South African Police Service, in its effort to curb the sale of stolen property by reducing the market, is calling upon dealers of second-hand goods and pawn brokers to apply for the renewal of their business registration.During the release of the latest crime statistics, aggravated robberies were highlighted as one of the problematic crimes. Another area of concern is issue of cable theft which has serious implications on the electricity and telecommunication infrastructure which ultimately impacts on service delivery at large.Therefore, every person who runs a business of dealing in second-hand goods in South Africa, had to apply to be registered under the provisions of the Second Hand Goods Act, 2009 (Act No 6 of 2009).All second-hand goods dealers who have registered from May 2016 onwards must note that the five-year registration period is expiring and registration to continue doing business in dealing with second-hand goods must be renewed.The Second-Hand Goods Act, 2009 came into effect on 30 April 2012 to regulate the business of dealers in second-hand goods and pawn brokering.The following process is applicable to all existing, registered second-hand goods dealers who must renew his/her registration: An application for renewal of registration must be made in terms of section 11 of the Act no more than 180 days and no less than 90 days before the expiry date of the existing registration.

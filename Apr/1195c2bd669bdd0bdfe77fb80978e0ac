This weekend sees the fourth leg of the Quattro Roag Series for mountain bikers and trail runners, and it represents a watershed for the popular KZN-based series which offers the biggest prizemoney of any mountain biking series in the country.With competitors needing to compete in six of the nine events to qualify as a series finisher, any rider who has not already taken part in one of the first three events needs to compete in the Husqvarna Classic Mid-Illovo MTB Challenge and Trail Run on Sunday, April 30, to have any chance of qualifying for the R25 000 first prize.The Compendium Hill 2 Hill that took place over Easter saw two new leaders emerge in the mountain biking series. Leeroy Emslie&#8217;s fourth place in the tough 100km marathon from Pietermaritzburg to Shongweni allowed him to take over the series lead in the men&#8217;s category.His 202 points from three events put him a meagre 22 points ahead of Stuart Marais, who missed the Hill 2 Hill due to other racing commitments in Gauteng.In the women&#8217;s division, young Christie-Leigh Hearder&#8217;s consistent finishes has allowed her to open up a sizable gap in the standings. Her 246 points are 60 more than second-placed veteran Natalie Bergstrom.In the trail running log, Mark Mackenzie grew his lead and goes into the fourth event with a 57-point gap over David Mercer, despite finding the pace tough at the Hill 2 Hill trail run where he finished 12th.In the women&#8217;s trail running, Wendy Mills and Alison Wasserfall have opened up a huge lead over the chasing bunch with Mills in pole position on 260-points with Wasserfall 44 points back.The 60km Husqvarna Classic is one of the most popular one day mountain bike events and the race organiser&#8217;s emphasis on superb trails means it is rare for a rider not to drive back from the event with a smile on his or her face.The event was also one of the first mountain bike races in the province to realise that a trail running event was a good addition to the day&#8217;s outdoor offerings. This has meant the Mid Illovo Classic is the oldest trail run event to be included in the new Quattro ROAG Trail Running Series which this year takes place in conjunction with the mountain biking series.After the Husqvarna Classic Mid-Illovo MTB Challenge and Trail Run this weekend, riders and runners have a month to recover until the Sappi Karkloof Classic in on 27 and 28 May.
